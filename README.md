# Algorithms Coursework

The following readme is about running the program with given test cases

## Main Scripts

Open the project in InteliJIdea and run the following file

```bash
MaxFlow.java
```

## Usage 

First, open the project in IntelliJ IDEA

### For pre-added test cases
You should define the test cases dataset by visiting the 
Run > Edit Configurations in the software. You should browse the path for each test case and apply the changes.

Once you run the application enter the number of vertices given for particular test cases. (Refer to the table below)

#### Predefined test case sizes

- Network_1.txt - 6
- Network_2.txt - 12
- Network_3.txt - 24
- Network_4.txt - 48
- Network_5.txt - 96
- Network_6.txt - 192
- Network_7.txt - 384
- Network_8.txt - 768

Click on the option (6) to import the test cases

Click on the option (3) to find the max flow

### For user input test cases
Once you run the application enter the number of vertices you are expecting your algorithm to have.

You can set nodes, edges and perform add, modify, delete operations as you wish. (Options are given in the menu)

In order to print the maximum flow, you can run the option (3)
